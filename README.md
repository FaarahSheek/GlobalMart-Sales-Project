# GlobalMart-Sales-Project
### Description:

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on GlobalMart’s sales data to better understand business performance across product categories, regions, and time periods.

### Motivation:
The motivation behind this project was to gain hands-on experience working with real-world retail data and extracting meaningful insights that can inform data-driven business decisions.

### Why this project was built:
The project was built to analyse how sales, profit, discounts, and seasonal trends interact, and to identify patterns that could help optimise pricing strategies, regional performance, and resource allocation.

### Problem it solves:
It transforms raw sales data into actionable insights by revealing trends, relationships, and potential areas of improvement within GlobalMart’s operations.

### What I learned:
Through this project, I learned how to clean and explore datasets, perform time-based and regional analysis, create effective visualisations, and interpret findings from a business and analytical perspective.


## Overview:


This project analyses GlobalMart’s sales data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover trends and patterns across multiple business dimensions:

- Product Categories
- Regions
- Time Periods
- Sales, Profit, and Discounts

The analysis supports data-driven decision-making by providing insights into sales performance, profitability, and seasonal behaviour.

### Commonly asked questions

1. Which tools and libraries were used?

The analysis was performed using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Statsmodels.

2. Did you observe any seasonal trends?

Yes. Sales displayed clear seasonal patterns, with higher sales toward the end of the year and lower sales in the early months.

3. How can this project be improved?

The project can be enhanced by adding sales forecasting, customer segmentation, profit margin analysis, and interactive dashboards.

### Key Steps

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded, cleaned, and prepared by handling missing values and converting date columns for analysis.
2. Data Exploration: Sales, profit, and discount data are analysed across product categories, regions, and time periods.
3. Visualisation & Analysis: Trends and relationships are visualised using bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
4. Interpretation: Insights are derived from the analysis to understand business performance and support decision-making.

Results

Visualisations and summary statistics provide insights into sales trends, regional performance, category-wise performance, seasonality, and the relationship between sales, profit, and discounts.
