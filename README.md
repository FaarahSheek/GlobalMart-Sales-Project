# GlobalMart-Sales-Project
### Description:

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on GlobalMart’s sales data to better understand business performance across product categories, regions, and time periods.

### Motivation:
The motivation behind this project was to gain hands-on experience working with real-world retail data and extracting meaningful insights that can inform data-driven business decisions.

### Why this project was built:
The project was built to analyse how sales, profit, discounts, and seasonal trends interact, and to identify patterns that could help optimise pricing strategies, regional performance, and resource allocation.

### Problem it solves:
It transforms raw sales data into actionable insights by revealing trends, relationships, and potential areas of improvement within GlobalMart’s operations.

### What I learned:
Through this project, I learned how to clean and explore datasets, perform time-based and regional analysis, create effective visualisations, and interpret findings from a business and analytical perspective.


## Overview
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of GlobalMart’s sales performance (2012–2015) to identify trends across regions, product categories,  and time periods, and assess factors influencing sales and profitability
